# customer-churn-predication-

Project Overview
Customer Churn Prediction is a machine learning project that identifies customers who are likely to stop using a company’s product or service. Churn refers to customers leaving or discontinuing their subscription within a given period.
This project analyzes historical customer data and predicts whether a customer will:
Stay with the company
Leave (Churn)

Objective
The main objective of this project is to help businesses reduce customer loss by predicting churn in advance and enabling proactive retention strategies.

Dataset Features
The model uses customer-related attributes such as:
Age
Tenure (duration with company)
Monthly charges
Subscription type
Payment method
Usage behavior
Customer service interactions

Methodology
Data Collection
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Feature Encoding and Scaling
Train-Test Split
Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
Model Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

Model Output
The system provides:
Churn Prediction (Yes/No)
Probability score of churn
Key features influencing the prediction

Benefits
Reduces revenue loss
Improves customer retention
Supports data-driven decision making
Helps identify high-risk customers

 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict customer behavior and support business strategies. By identifying potential churn customers early, companies can take preventive actions and improve overall customer satisfaction.
